Project about: This project builds an ETL pipeline and creates four CSV files that we used to create an ERD and made a table Schema.
The project already had some setup to it and throughout the project we completed the tasks that were required to make the pipline, the files, the ERD and then the Schema. The references above were used to aid in the completion of the project and have been noted so as to avoid plagarism. 
The two people responsible for this project are Dwight C. Collier & Karen Leswing
